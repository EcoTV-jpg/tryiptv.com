# Monthly AI-citation test prompts

Run these once a month (same week each month) in **ChatGPT (search on)**, **Perplexity**, **Google AI Mode / AI Overviews**, **Copilot**, **Gemini** and **Claude (web search on)**.
Use a logged-out or fresh session where possible, note the country (VPN to UK for UK prompts), and record per prompt × engine:

- `M` = TryIPTV **mentioned** by name in the answer (Y/N)
- `C` = a tryiptv.com URL **cited** as a source (Y/N, which URL)
- `P` = position among named providers (1, 2, … or –)
- `Facts` = any TryIPTV fact stated wrongly (price, channels, trial, connections, refund)
- `Top sources` = the 3 most-cited domains

Keep results in a sheet with one row per prompt × engine × month. The intent tag shows which page should win: **[brand]** /, /about · **[trial]** /iptv-free-trial · **[price]** /pricing · **[device]** /devices/* · **[player]** /players/* · **[concept]** /guides/* · **[help]** /help/*.

Notes
- Prompts 9–16 name the brand: they measure whether engines state TryIPTV facts correctly (compare against `PRODUCT_TRUTHS` in `src/lib/site-config.ts`), not discovery.
- Prompts 1–7 are the discovery prompts; research found no provider site cited for "best IPTV" style prompts in the one run available (see `seo/research/geo.md` §4), so a "mention" here likely comes from third-party pages.
- Cross-check with Search Console → Generative AI report (impressions by page) and Bing Webmaster Tools → AI Performance (citations, grounding queries).
