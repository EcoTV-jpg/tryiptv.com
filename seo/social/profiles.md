# Social profiles, review platforms and directories

Researched 2026-10-20. Sources are in `seo/research/brand.md` §4–5.

**Use the same strings on every profile.** Copy them from `src/lib/site-data/brand.ts`:
- **Name:** `TryIPTV`
- **Website:** `https://www.tryiptv.com`
- **Tagline:** `Prepaid IPTV with a 24-hour free trial`
- **Short bio (≤160 characters):** `Prepaid IPTV service: live TV and on-demand video on your own devices and player apps. No auto-renewal, 24-hour free trial.`
- **Long description:** `BRAND.description` (2 sentences)
- **Avatar:** `/brand-logo-square.png` (symbol). Cover or banner: `/logo.png` on `#040506`.
- **Contact:** support@tryiptv.com · WhatsApp +212 694-833293 (wa.me/tryiptvcom)

**Rules**
- Add a profile to `sameAs` in `src/lib/site-data/socials.ts` (`publicBrandSocialLinks`) only after it exists, is owned by TryIPTV and is active.
- No bought followers, reviews or engagement. Bing calls this "artificial social promotion schemes"; Google treats it as spam.
- **Gate before every signup:** most review platforms and social networks remove services that "facilitate illegal products or services". A removed or warning-flagged profile is negative evidence that AI engines can find. Open these profiles only once the content-licensing answers in `seo/eeat-confirm.md` (questions 15–18) are settled.

## Do not create

| Platform | Reason |
|---|---|
| **Google Business Profile** | "online-only businesses" are ineligible, and virtual offices break the rules ([GBP eligibility](https://support.google.com/business/answer/13763036)). |
| **Bing Places** | Needs a customer-facing address or service area. Not suitable for an online-only service [UNCONFIRMED; page didn't render]. |
| **Wikipedia article** | <ul><li>Notability requires "significant coverage in multiple reliable secondary sources that are independent of the subject" ([WP:NCORP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(organizations_and_companies))).</li><li>Paid editing must be disclosed.</li><li>An article would be deleted.</li></ul> |
| **Wikidata item** | Only after several independent, reliable references exist; a self-sourced item gets deleted. |
| **G2, Capterra, Product Hunt** | B2B software and launch platforms, so not a fit for a subscription service. Product Hunt suits a real tool later; see linkable asset #2. |
| **Yelp** | Local businesses only. |
| **"SEO directories", bookmark sites, link directories** | "Low-quality directory or bookmark site links" are link spam (Google spam policies). |
| **Quora** | Cited in AI Overviews and AI Mode, but only useful with genuine expert answers. Skip until there is a named expert (eeat-confirm question 30). |
