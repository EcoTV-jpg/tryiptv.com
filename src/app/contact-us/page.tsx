  },
  {
    question: "My app is not working. Does that mean my subscription is not working?",
    answer: `Not always. In most cases the issue comes from the player app, not the subscription. Try another supported app, such as TiviMate or IPTV Smarters, before contacting us. ${a("/players", "Compare IPTV players")}.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Why do some or all channels show “No Information” in the EPG?",
    answer: `The EPG (electronic programme guide) is the on-screen TV schedule inside your player app. Some channels do not provide complete guide information. If this is your first time setting up IPTV, allow a few minutes for the guide to download and sync, then refresh it. ${a("/help/epg-not-working", "EPG troubleshooting guide")}.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide apps with the subscription?",

  },
  {
    question: "Live TV works, but movies or series do not. What should I do?",
    answer: "Try a different player app first. Some apps have problems with on-demand (VOD) content while live channels keep working normally. If another app has the same problem, message support.",
  },
  {
    question: "I entered my login details and it says invalid. Why?",
    answer: `An invalid login almost always means a small typing error. Check the username, the password and the server (portal) URL, and make sure each is entered exactly as provided, with no extra spaces. Copying and pasting is recommended. ${a("/help/iptv-login-not-working", "Login troubleshooting guide")}.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use my subscription on more than one device?",
    answer: `Yes. Every TryIPTV plan includes ${T.connections} simultaneous connections: you can install your login on several of your own devices, but only ${T.connections} can stream at the same time. Using more may cause connection problems.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I find the installation guide?",

  },
  {
    question: "I want faster support. What should I include in my message?",
