    question: "Is Xtream Codes the same as an IPTV player app?",
    answer:
      "No. Xtream Codes is a client-server API connection format, not a media player application. Applications such as TiviMate, IPTV Smarters, Televizo, and XCIPTV are independent media players designed to log into IPTV services that support this API structure.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Xtream Codes an official Internet or telecom standard?",
    answer:
      "No. Xtream Codes was originally proprietary server panel software developed in the mid-2010s by Xtream Codes Ltd. While the original software platform is no longer active, its client-server API structure became a de facto convention widely implemented by modern IPTV middleware and third-party player applications. It has never been formalized as an IETF, W3C, or ISO standard.",
  },
  {
    question: "What information do I need to log into an Xtream-compatible player?",
    answer:
      "To connect an Xtream-compatible player, you generally need three core pieces of information supplied by your IPTV provider: a Server URL (such as http://example.com:8080), a Username, and a Password. Some player interfaces also provide a friendly 'Account Name' field for your own reference.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the server port always entered in a separate field?",
    answer:
      "No. Port handling depends on the user interface of the specific player app you use. Many modern applications (like TiviMate and IPTV Smarters) ask for a single Server URL field where the port is included at the end (e.g., http://tv.server.net:8000). Other players provide a distinct 'Port' field. When connecting over standard HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443), explicit port numbers are often omitted.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are Xtream Codes credentials safe to share?",
    answer:
      "No. Your Xtream credentials grant direct access to your subscription and allow streaming on your account. Because traditional Xtream requests pass your username and password in the URL query string, sharing full links or screenshots exposes your private login details.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do if my Xtream Codes login fails?",
    answer:
      "If you receive an 'Invalid Details' or 401 Unauthorized error, verify that you haven't accidentally copied trailing whitespace into the username or password fields, verify that the server protocol (http:// vs. https://) and port are accurate, and confirm that your account subscription remains active with your provider.",

                In modern IPTV, <strong className="text-foreground font-semibold">Xtream Codes</strong> refers
                to a structured client-server login format that uses a{" "}
                <span className="text-foreground font-medium">Server URL</span>,{" "}
                <span className="text-foreground font-medium">Username</span>, and{" "}

              <p>
                Instead of reading a single static text playlist, an Xtream-compatible player issues
                lightweight HTTP/HTTPS requests to retrieve structured JSON data—allowing it to fetch
                categories, channel lists, on-demand movies, and TV guide (EPG) schedules dynamically. It is
                not a formal standards body specification, but rather a de facto compatibility convention
                adopted across third-party IPTV software.

              <h2>Origins and Evolution of the Format</h2>
              <p>
                To understand why Xtream Codes exists, it helps to look at its history. In the mid-2010s, a
                software company named Xtream Codes Ltd created a popular commercial streaming management
                panel. The panel featured an internal Application Programming Interface (API) that enabled
                mobile and TV apps to authenticate users, check subscription validity, and fetch channel
                lineups.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although the original company ceased operations in September 2019 following European legal
                enforcement actions, the client-server API architecture it popularized had already become the
                unspoken standard for third-party media players. Today, alternative IPTV middleware platforms
                and open-source panels emulate the identical API endpoints so that popular applications
                (including TiviMate, IPTV Smarters, Televizo, and XCIPTV) continue to work seamlessly.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Important Distinction:</strong> Xtream Codes is <em>not</em> an official Internet
                standard ratified by the IETF, W3C, ISO, or ITU. It is a de facto protocol convention that
                gained widespread adoption because its structured API allows compatible apps to query
                categories and account data on demand rather than relying only on a static playlist file.
              </p>

              <h2>What Information Does the User Enter?</h2>
              <p>
                When you configure an IPTV player using an Xtream Codes login option, the application typically
                presents a login dialog requesting three primary credentials:

            <ArticleProse>
              <p>
                <strong>Port Handling Varies by App:</strong> Some older tutorials claim that four separate
                fields are universally mandatory: Server, Port, Username, and Password. In reality, field
                layout depends on the specific app interface. Modern players frequently expect the port to be
                included directly inside the Server URL (e.g., <code>http://example.com:8080</code>). When a
                service operates over standard HTTP (port 80) or standard HTTPS (port 443), no port number is
                required at all.
              </p>

              <h2>How Common Xtream-Compatible APIs Function</h2>
              <p>
                While implementations vary across different server panels, common Xtream-compatible systems
                expose a core API endpoint—traditionally named <code>/player_api.php</code>.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a player launches or synchronizes content, it initiates an HTTP or HTTPS request to this
                endpoint, supplying the user&apos;s credentials as URL query parameters.
              </p>

              <h3>Illustrative Request Example</h3>
              <p>
                In a standard initial handshake, the player sends an authentication request structured
                similarly to this conceptual example:
              </p>
            </ArticleProse>

            <ArticleCodeBlock
              title="Illustrative API Handshake Request"
              code={`GET /player_api.php?username=EXAMPLE_USER&password=EXAMPLE_PASS HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com`}
            />

            <ArticleProse>
              <p className="text-base sm:text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                <em>Note: The URL above is a sanitized illustrative example. Never share your active provider
                credentials publicly.</em>
              </p>

              <h3>Structured JSON Response</h3>
              <p>
                If authentication succeeds, the server returns a structured JSON payload rather than a raw
                video stream. Common responses include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>User Information (<code>user_info</code>):</strong> Account status (active/expired),
                  subscription expiration timestamp, created date, and maximum concurrent connections allowed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Server Information (<code>server_info</code>):</strong> Server timezone, active
                  protocol, supported container formats (such as MPEG-TS or HLS), and server port.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>On-Demand Content Queries</h3>
              <p>
                Once authenticated, the player can request specific subsets of content using dedicated query
                actions:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><code>action=get_live_categories</code>: Retrieves live TV genre groupings (e.g., Sports, News).</li>
                <li><code>action=get_live_streams&amp;category_id=...</code>: Retrieves channels within a selected category.</li>
                <li><code>action=get_vod_categories</code>: Retrieves video-on-demand movie categories.</li>
                <li><code>action=get_series</code>: Retrieves organized TV series with seasons and episode metadata.</li>
                <li><code>action=get_short_epg&amp;stream_id=...</code>: Fetches program guide data for specific channels.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>How Xtream Codes Organizes Content</h2>
              <p>
                The primary practical benefit of an API-based system like Xtream Codes is structured content
                organization. Because the server groups content into discrete categories, player applications
                can display clean, interactive menus:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Hierarchical Navigation:</strong> Live channels, movies, and TV series are
                  separated into dedicated application sections rather than lumped into an unorganized list.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Metadata Integration:</strong> Movie and series entries can include poster artwork,
                  plot summaries, cast lists, release years, and episodic structures directly from the API.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Dynamic EPG Association:</strong> Program guide information is linked directly to
                  internal stream IDs, minimizing the need for users to manually configure third-party XMLTV
                  guide URLs.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>
              <p>
                Understanding how Xtream Codes handles security is essential for keeping your account
                protected:
              </p>

              <h3>1. Query String Credentials (RFC 9110 Considerations)</h3>
              <p>
                The legacy Xtream Codes design transmits the username and password directly within the URL
                query string. In standard web security architectures (such as those outlined in RFC 9110
                Section 4.3), sending sensitive secrets in URLs is discouraged because query strings can be
                recorded in server access logs, browser histories, and proxy caches.
              </p>
              <p>
                To minimize exposure, always ensure your provider supports connection via encrypted{" "}
                <strong>HTTPS</strong> rather than plain HTTP, and never share full API query URLs in public
                forums or support threads.
              </p>

              <h3>2. Concurrent Connection Limits</h3>
              <p>
                Because the API server tracks active sessions, IPTV providers typically enforce strict
                concurrent connection caps (for example, two or three active devices simultaneously). If you
                attempt to stream on more devices than your subscription allows, the server will either drop the
                oldest stream or return an authentication refusal on the new device.
              </p>

              <h2>Player Compatibility: Players That Support Xtream Codes</h2>
              <p>
                Almost all major dedicated IPTV applications feature native support for Xtream-style API

                <strong>General Media Players:</strong> General-purpose media players like VLC or Kodi can play
                individual stream URLs generated by an Xtream server, but they do not natively parse the
                multi-category API menus without specialized third-party add-ons.

              <h2>What Xtream Codes Does Not Do</h2>
              <p>
                A common misconception among new IPTV users is that Xtream Codes is a provider or service. It is
                important to distinguish the connection protocol from content:
              </p>
              <p>
                Having an Xtream-compatible player does not provide any video content on its own. You must have
                an active subscription with an IPTV service provider to supply valid server, username, and
                password details.
              </p>
