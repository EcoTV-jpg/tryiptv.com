  {
    question: "What internet speed do I need?",
    answer:
      "A download speed of at least 10 Mbps with low, stable latency works for standard streams (SD and 720p). For Full HD, plan on about 25 Mbps, and about 50 Mbps for 4K. Each extra screen streaming at the same time needs its own share.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is IPTV legal?",
    answer:
      "IPTV is just a delivery technology and is legal in itself. Whether a particular service is legal depends on whether the provider holds the proper rights to the content it streams, so choose a reputable provider. This is general information, not legal advice.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which app should I use?",
    answer:
      "It depends on your device. Smart IPTV and Set IPTV are popular on Samsung and LG TVs, TiviMate is a favourite on Android TV and Firestick, and IPTV Smarters works well across Android, iOS, Windows, and Mac.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does IPTV stand for?",
    answer:
      "IPTV stands for Internet Protocol Television. It means TV channels and on-demand video are delivered as data over an internet connection, instead of through a cable line, satellite dish, or antenna, and played in an app on a TV, streaming stick, phone, or computer.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you have to pay for IPTV?",
    answer:
      "Usually, yes. Licensed IPTV services charge a subscription because they pay for the rights to their channels. IPTV player apps are often free or cheap, but they contain no channels. A free trial, such as the 24-hour TryIPTV trial, lets you test before paying.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I watch IPTV for free?",
    answer:
      "Some broadcasters offer free, legal streams of their own channels, but free lists of premium channels are almost always unlicensed and can be unsafe or illegal to use. A free trial from a paid service is the safer way to test IPTV on your own device before you subscribe.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is IPTV the same as Netflix or YouTube TV?",
    answer:
      "Not exactly. Netflix is an on-demand streaming service, and YouTube TV is a live TV streaming service with its own app. IPTV usually means a service that supplies live channels as a playlist or Xtream Codes login that you open in a separate IPTV player app.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does IPTV connect to a TV?",
    answer:
      "IPTV reaches a TV through an app. Install an IPTV player on a smart TV, or on a Firestick, Android TV box, Apple TV, or MAG box plugged into the TV, then enter the login details from your service. Phones can also send IPTV to a TV with AirPlay or casting.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a VPN for IPTV?",
    answer:
      "No, a VPN is not required to use IPTV. A VPN can help you test whether your internet provider slows video traffic, but it adds overhead and can reduce speed. If streams buffer, check your connection and player settings first using the IPTV buffering guide.",

                IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) delivers multimedia content over the internet, giving
                you a wide range of live channels, on-demand video, and customization options. Instead of
                receiving a signal through a cable or satellite dish, your device streams TV directly over
                your internet connection.
              </p>

              <h2>How IPTV works</h2>
              <p>
                IPTV sends television content as data packets over the internet. When you open a channel,
                your IPTV app requests that stream from a server and plays it in real time. The same
                technology also powers video on demand (VOD), so you can watch movies and series whenever
                you want. For the full step-by-step picture, read{" "}

              <h2>What you need to use IPTV</h2>
              <p>To get started with IPTV, you need three things:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>An internet connection</strong>: a minimum of about 10 Mbps download speed with
                  low, stable latency for smooth standard-quality playback; about 25 Mbps for Full HD and
                  50 Mbps for 4K. You can check your connection at{" "}
                  <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">speedtest.net</a>,
                  and read our <Link href="/guides/iptv-internet-speed">IPTV internet speed guide</Link>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>An IPTV application</strong>: both free and premium options are available
                  depending on your device.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>An IPTV subscription</strong>: provided as an M3U link or Xtream Codes
                  credentials. TryIPTV supplies both, and you can test it first with a{" "}
                  {PRODUCT_TRUTHS.trialDuration.toLowerCase()} <Link href="/iptv-free-trial">free trial</Link>.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <h2>What is an M3U link?</h2>
              <p>
                An M3U link is a playlist file from your IPTV provider that contains all of your channels and
                VOD content. You simply paste it into your IPTV app, which then loads your entire lineup at
                once. Many apps also accept Xtream Codes credentials (server URL, username, and password) as
                an alternative, and the EPG adds the TV guide.

              <h2>How IPTV differs from cable or satellite</h2>
              <p>
                Traditional TV systems are built around dedicated delivery networks. Cable TV arrives
                through coaxial or fiber infrastructure, satellite TV arrives from a dish, and
                broadcast TV arrives over the air. IPTV uses the same general internet connection you
                use for websites, apps, and video calls. For an in-depth side-by-side breakdown of costs,
                equipment, contracts, and reliability tradeoffs, see our complete guide on{" "}

              <h2>What you can watch with IPTV</h2>
              <p>
                IPTV can include live channels, sports channels, movies, series, catch-up features,
                and programme guide data. The exact library depends on the service, plan, region,
                device, and player support. TryIPTV&apos;s current product configuration lists{" "}
                {PRODUCT_TRUTHS.channels} live channels and {PRODUCT_TRUTHS.vod} movies and series,
                with {PRODUCT_TRUTHS.connections} simultaneous connections on prepaid plans.
              </p>

              <h2>Internet speed and buffering basics</h2>
              <p>
                IPTV quality depends on a stable connection, not just the number printed on a speed
                test. Wi-Fi congestion, distance from the router, old devices, app cache, stream
                quality, and local network traffic can all affect playback. For recommended bandwidth
                targets and multi-device planning, read our <Link href="/guides/iptv-internet-speed">IPTV internet speed guide</Link>,
                or consult our <Link href="/help/iptv-buffering">IPTV buffering troubleshooting checklist</Link> to resolve active freezing.
              </p>

              <h2>Is IPTV right for you?</h2>
              <p>
                IPTV is useful when you want internet-based TV access across flexible devices, but
                it works best when you are comfortable installing an app and entering service
                credentials. It is not identical to a cable box experience, and the best setup
                depends on your device, player, and internet connection.
              </p>

              <h2 id="is-iptv-legal">Is IPTV legal?</h2>
              <p>
                IPTV technology is legal: it is simply a way of delivering television over the internet,
                and major licensed services use it. Whether a particular IPTV service is legal depends on
                whether it has the rights to the channels and films it streams. Watching or selling
                unlicensed streams can break copyright law.
              </p>
              <h3>Is IPTV legal in the US?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes, IPTV itself is legal in the US. Running an unlicensed streaming service for profit is
                a federal crime under the Protecting Lawful Streaming Act of 2020{" "}
                (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2319C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18 U.S.C. § 2319C</a>),
                which targets the people who operate such services. Viewers of unlicensed streams can
                still be liable for copyright infringement.

              <h3>Is IPTV legal in the UK?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes, IPTV and streaming devices are legal in the UK. The UK government states that
                streaming boxes become illegal to use once apps or add-ons give access to paid-for
                content for free{" "}
                (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pressure-grows-on-producers-of-illegal-streaming-devices-and-thieves-of-paid-for-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK, October 2018</a>),
                and the EU Court of Justice ruled in 2017 that streaming unlicensed content is not
                lawful (<a href="https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-527/15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">case C-527/15</a>).
