              TiviMate is one of the most advanced and easiest IPTV players to use, with a smooth, modern interface built for big-screen Android devices, and a top choice among Android IPTV apps. It is a player, not a source of channels: you add the playlist or login details from your IPTV provider. Its focus is live TV; movies and series depend on your app version and your provider&apos;s playlist, so check them on your setup.

              <p className={textClass}>
                TiviMate is a TV-focused IPTV player by Armobsoft FZE. It organizes playlists you supply; it does not provide streams or endorse a provider. Before setup, get a direct M3U URL, Xtream Codes server URL and account details, or a Stalker Portal address if your provider supports that method. These are separate from any TiviMate Premium account.
              </p>
              <p className={textClass}>
                The official app listing confirms support for M3U, Xtream Codes, and Stalker Portal. If you only have a provider website login, ask the provider which playlist method to use. <Link href="/guides/what-are-xtream-codes" className={linkClass}>Xtream Codes credentials</Link> are one common option.

                TiviMate is available for Android TV, Google TV, and Fire TV Stick devices. A free, limited version is in the Google Play Store, and Fire TV users install the official APK (steps below). TiviMate Premium is a paid upgrade, sold yearly or as a one-time lifetime purchase, that unlocks features such as recording and multiple playlists. Prices vary by region and change over time, so check the current price in TiviMate&apos;s own purchase flow before buying. Premium is paid to TiviMate&apos;s developer and is separate from your IPTV subscription.

Enter the server URL, username, and password supplied by your IPTV provider, then save the playlist and wait for channels to load. The server URL identifies the service endpoint; the username and password identify your IPTV account. TiviMate does not issue those credentials.

Do not paste a provider homepage or shorten the address. Because an M3U URL may contain account information, keep it private.

                TiviMate&apos;s official Google Play listing includes Stalker Portal among its supported playlist formats. Choose this method only when your provider specifically gives you a Stalker Portal address and any required device or MAC-related details. A regular Xtream Codes server address is not interchangeable with a Stalker Portal URL.

              <p className={textClass}>
                EPG is the electronic program guide that displays schedules beside channels. TiviMate supports an EPG grid, but guide entries depend on the provider&apos;s data and channel mapping. A playlist may already carry an associated guide source. If schedules stay blank and your provider supplied a separate EPG or XMLTV URL, add it in TiviMate&apos;s EPG source settings and update the guide.
              </p>
              <p className={textClass}>
                Check the URL, source assignment, update status, and channel IDs before changing playback settings. Channels can work while EPG data fails independently. See the <Link href="/help/epg-not-working" className={linkClass}>EPG troubleshooting guide</Link> for missing or stale schedules.

              <h2 className={headingClass}>TiviMate Free vs Premium</h2>
              <p className={textClass}>
                TiviMate can be installed and used as a player without buying a channel subscription from its developer. Premium is an upgrade for app features; it does not include IPTV content. TiviMate officially lists multiple playlists, favorites, catch-up, recording, search, parental controls, personalization, and multiview as app capabilities, but access to individual features may depend on the current app version and entitlement.
              </p>
              <p className={textClass}>
                To activate Premium, use TiviMate&apos;s own purchase or sign-in flow and follow its on-screen instructions. Check the current feature list, device terms, and price in that official flow before purchasing; published prices and entitlements can change. Your IPTV provider login remains separate from the TiviMate account.

                There is no single best TiviMate setting for every stream. Start with default playback settings, then change one control at a time for a specific problem. Use playlist and EPG update controls when channels or guide data are stale; use favorites and group organization to make navigation easier. TiviMate also lists personalization and parental controls among its app features.

              <p className={textClass}>
                You normally do not install channels individually in TiviMate. Channels arrive through the M3U, Xtream Codes, or Stalker Portal playlist supplied by your IPTV provider. Refresh the playlist when the provider changes its lineup; if a channel is still absent, ask the provider whether it belongs to your account. TiviMate can help you navigate the channels it receives with favorites and playlist organization.

              <p className={textClass}>
                First identify whether TiviMate cannot load the playlist, can load it but cannot authenticate or play streams, or can play streams without guide data. Record the error text, playlist type, device model, and a few affected channel names before contacting support. If the same playlist fails in another compatible player, the provider or connection is a stronger suspect than TiviMate.
