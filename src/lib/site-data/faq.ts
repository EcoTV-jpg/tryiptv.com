        question: "What is IPTV?",
        answer: `IPTV is television delivered over the internet instead of cable or satellite. Live channels and on-demand titles stream to an app on your TV, streaming stick, phone or computer, using your home broadband. ${a("/guides/what-is-iptv", "Read the full guide to what IPTV is")}.`,
      },
      {
        question: "What does IPTV stand for?",
        answer: "IPTV stands for Internet Protocol Television. Internet Protocol (IP) is the same system that carries web pages and video calls; IPTV uses it to carry TV channels.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does IPTV work?",
        answer: `A provider sends TV streams over the internet, and an IPTV player app on your device plays them. You enter your login (an Xtream Codes server, username and password, or an M3U playlist URL) in the player, and it loads the channel list, the TV guide and the on-demand library. ${a("/guides/how-does-iptv-work", "See how IPTV works step by step")}.`,
      },
      {
        question: "How do I get IPTV?",
        answer: `You need three things: a compatible device, an IPTV player app, and a subscription. With TryIPTV you can start with a ${a("/iptv-free-trial", "24-hour free trial")} on WhatsApp, then choose a ${a("/pricing", "prepaid plan")} if you want to keep it.`,
      },
      {
        question: "Does IPTV work anywhere?",
        answer: `IPTV works anywhere you have a stable internet connection fast enough for the picture quality you want. Around 25 Mbps is comfortable for one HD stream and 50 Mbps for 4K. ${a("/guides/iptv-internet-speed", "Check how much speed IPTV needs")}.`,
      },
      {
        question: "What is the difference between IPTV and regular streaming apps?",
        answer: "IPTV gives you live TV channels on a schedule, with a TV guide, much like cable. Streaming apps such as Netflix are mostly on-demand libraries from one company. Many IPTV services, TryIPTV included, offer both live channels and an on-demand library in one login, watched through a player app you choose.",

        question: "Is IPTV cheaper than cable?",
        answer: `Usually, yes. TryIPTV costs ${FACT_TEXT.fromPrice} for one month and works out to ${FACT_TEXT.lowestMonthly} a month on the 12-month plan, with no box rental or installation. Compare that with your current cable bill. ${a("/guides/iptv-vs-cable", "Read IPTV vs cable")}.`,
      },
      {
        question: "IPTV vs satellite: which is better?",
        answer: "IPTV is better if you have good broadband and want to watch on several kinds of device; satellite is better where internet is slow or unreliable, because it does not depend on your connection. Satellite also needs a dish and installation; IPTV only needs an app.",
      },
      {
        question: "Why is IPTV so much cheaper than cable?",
        answer: "IPTV has no cables to lay, no dishes or boxes to install, and no technicians to send out: the stream reaches you over the internet you already pay for. Pricing also depends on how a service obtains its channels, so a very low price is worth asking questions about (see the legality answers below).",
      },
      {
        question: "Is IPTV worth it if I barely watch TV?",
        answer: `It can be: a 1-month plan at ${FACT_TEXT.fromPrice} covers the months you do watch, such as a tournament or a season finale, and nothing renews automatically. If you watch only a handful of shows, one streaming app may be cheaper.`,
      },
      {
        question: "What should I check before switching from cable?",
        answer: `Check four things during a ${a("/iptv-free-trial", "free trial")}: that your must-have channels are there, that streams stay smooth at peak evening hours, that the player works on every TV you use, and that your internet speed is enough for everyone watching at once. Also check any cable contract end date and cancellation fee.`,
      },
      {
        question: "What are the drawbacks of IPTV?",
        answer: `IPTV depends on your internet: a slow or busy connection means buffering. Channel line-ups can change, setup takes a few minutes with a player app, and there is no technician visit. Legality also depends on the provider (see below). Test first with the ${a("/iptv-free-trial", "free trial")}.`,

        answer: `Order a new plan the same way you ordered the first one: tap a plan on the ${a("/pricing", "pricing page")} to open WhatsApp and say you are renewing. Nothing renews automatically, so you are never charged without asking.`,
      },
      {
        question: "How do I pay for an IPTV subscription?",

      },
      {
        question: "Can I upgrade my plan or add more devices later?",

        question: "What happens when my IPTV subscription expires?",

        question: "Can I watch IPTV in 4K?",
        answer: `Yes, where a channel or title is available in 4K. You also need a 4K screen, a 4K-capable device and about 50 Mbps of stable internet. ${a("/guides/iptv-internet-speed", "Check the speed guide")}.`,

        question: "How do I get more channels on IPTV?",

      {
        question: "Does IPTV handle game nights without buffering?",

        question: "Are there legal IPTV providers?",
        answer: "Yes. Many broadcasters and TV operators deliver licensed live TV over the internet through their own apps and services. Whether any service is licensed for your country is something to check with the provider.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if you don't use a VPN with IPTV?",
        answer: "Usually nothing: IPTV works normally without a VPN. Your internet provider can see that you are streaming and how much data you use, as with any streaming app, and some providers slow down heavy video traffic.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are free VPNs safe to use with IPTV?",
        answer: "Often not a good idea. Free VPNs tend to be slow, have data caps that run out quickly with video, and some log or sell user data. If you want a VPN, choose a reputable paid one with a no-logs policy.",
      },
